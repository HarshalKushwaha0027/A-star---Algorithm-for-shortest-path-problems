# A-star---Algorithm-for-shortest-path-problems
 This project dives into the A* algorithm, a smart way to solve shortest path problems seen in robotics, AI, transport, and games. By combining real distance and a smart guess (heuristic), A* finds the best path faster than older methodsâ€”making it both efficient and powerful in complex systems.
